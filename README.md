# Microsoft Excel VBA Time Mangement Tool
This is an interactive Excel tool built using VBA programming and macros to provide users assistance with managing their time. 

To develop this tool, I:

- Took on a project management role, leading a team of 6 to design and implement a Time Management Tool in Excel.
  
- Defined technical requirements and project scope, planned execution strategies, and designed both the tool and its user interface using Excel VBA.

- Maintained regular communication with the team via Slack and MS Teams, collaborating weekly to conduct research, refine project plans, build prototypes, and perform thorough testing to ensure the tool met end-user requirements.
