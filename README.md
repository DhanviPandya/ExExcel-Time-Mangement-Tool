# Microsoft Excel VBA Time Mangement Tool
This interactive Excel tool, developed using VBA programming and macros, helps users manage their time through a dynamic calendar that tracks daily activities and generates personalized to-do lists for users to follow

To develop this tool, I:

- Took on a project management role, leading a team of 6 to design and implement a Time Management Tool in Excel.
  
- Defined technical requirements and project scope, planned execution strategies, and designed both the tool and its user interface using Excel VBA.

- Maintained regular communication with the team via Slack and MS Teams, collaborating weekly to conduct research, refine project plans, build prototypes, and perform thorough testing to ensure the tool met end-user requirements.
